	<h2><u>Club of 2017</u></h2>
	
	<h3>Joshua Zietlow: Advisor/Founder</h3>

	<h4>This club has been an exciting realization of what I have hoped for: a community of technology enthusiasts to learn, grow, and build together. We have some exciting projects for the future.</h4>

	<h4>My vision/hope for this club is to give the students as South Umpqua the opportunity to build a future in computer technology whether that be learning how to "program" in a variety of languages or being able to fix and troubleshoot most computer issues. I want these students to have fun learning and to thrive in the future.</h4>

	<h3>Austyn Bellinger: President/Founder/Programmer</h3>

	<h4>"Honestly, when I first though about starting a computer club was way back in 6th grade, back when the only kind of computer use we were allowed was typing out word docs and power points. Fast forward... lets say... 5 years, and here I am. The President of the computer club, I hope that all future members of the club can have just as much if not more fun than we did in our very first club meeting."</h4>
