	"Honestly, when I first though about starting a computer club was way back in 6th grade, back when the only kind of computer use we were allowed was typing out word docs and power points. Fast forward... lets say... 5 years, and here I am. The President of the computer club, I hope that all future members of the club can have just as much if not more fun than we did in our very first club meeting."
