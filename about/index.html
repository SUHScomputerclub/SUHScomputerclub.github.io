	<p>If you’re reading this, then that means you may be considering whether to join the Computer club, if your first reaction is “We have a Computer Club?” That’s normal. The club was started in the first semester of 2017 and have only been picking up steam since then. Unlike most other clubs in the school we have no school funding and our equipment is second hand. We have very few requirements for entering the club. Our largest requirement is that if you join (Or decide to spend time in the Club room during meeting times) that you must stay respectful and considerate of the others in the club. Excessive yelling, non-productive arguing, and general inflammation is not allowed and will not be tolerated, those who decide to break these rules are not to be allowed back to club meetings, events, and other associated activities such as field trips</p>

	<p>Our second requirement
	An issue to be discussed is the problem of illegal activity when the club is in session, if you are a member of the computer club, you are representative of the club as a whole and your activities reflect on the position of the club. Any activity such as Piracy (The illegal acquiring of digital content you yourself have not payed fully for), Hacking, Doxing (The illegal distribution of personal and private information of another person without the express permission, cyberbullying, and any other possible illegal activity not listed here. The gist is don’t break the law in the club or we will be forced to call the police.</p>
