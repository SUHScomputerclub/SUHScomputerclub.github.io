	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

	<p>	As you have already seen, My name is Austyn Bellinger. I'm a high school student with skills in Computer science, Programming, Graphic design, Game development, and Microsoft office applications (Including, non-Microsoft office suites such as WPS office and Libre Office).</p>

	<p>	My hobbies include include programming, Video games and there creation. People such as Gabe Newell, Danny Baranowsky, and Markus Persson serve as inspirations for me. They and many, many other men and women paved the way for me want to come into the world of technology. I am not an expert and will never advertise myself as one, my skill and knowledge are self taught and are likely flawed and in the future I will do my absolute best to improve so that I may be able to hold my head high among my idols. </p>

	<p>I would like to give special thanks to a few people in my personal life:</p> 

	<p>Timothy Marshall, He is a close friend of mine and one of the few people that I have ever met who loves every second of ever day. He does what he loves and is one of the most optimistic people I know. I personally credit him with getting me into this world of the Internet, helping me meet some of my closest other friends and generally being the gateway into my future. If you are reading this tim, thank you.</p>

	<p>Joshua Zietlow, He is the man that single handedly took my idea of a computer club in my small rural high school and elevated it to something that me and all members of the club are able to be proud of, He is one of the schools English Teachers and is generally one of the most understanding teachers I have ever met. He has a love of pop culture, speaks Japanese, and is the reason that I created this website. If you are reading this Mr. Zietlow, Thank you. </p>
